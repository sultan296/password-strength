# password-strength

In this project, I created a website that demonstrates password strength using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features an interactive password input field that visually indicates the strength of the entered password, categorizing it as weak, medium, or strong. By changing colors and styles dynamically, the interface provides instant feedback and security awareness.
